>**To run the scripts, please, use the docker compose.**

The rules are simple:

1. Clone the repo by using `git clone`, or any other way
2. `cd` into the cloned repo
3. Install (if you don't already have) the docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
4. CREATE `.env` FILE IN THE ROOT (for this example you can just copy the contents of `.env.example`)
5. Perform `docker build` and then `docker compose up` in the root of the project
6. Access the application at the address `127.0.0.1:8000/`

> Additionally, if you want to see the contents of mongo db, you can go to `127.0.0.1:8081/` to explore the db with mongo-express
